      <h3>Why Tame Impala should be at the top of your concert list.</h3>
      <main>
         <!--Here's why I love Tame Impala-->
         
         <p>Tame Impala is a unique band that features non-traditional sounds that range from the a-typical guitar, to an incoherent hum.</p>
         <p>Tame Impala is an Australian, alternative band that for some, is their "kind of music." However, their differing sounds can often disuade some
            from listening. They are often lumped into the Alternative Rock category, and recently, their music has been labeled as a "psychedelic rock act." 
            Tame, as true fans often call them, started as a home recording project, that soon expanded. The band features five guys, who unfortunately, are not
            that attractive. Do not let that deter you! Keep reading and I'll tell you why I love them and most importantly, why you should too.
         </p>
         <p>Some of my favorite Tame Impala songs are: "List of People(To Try and Forget About)", "Love/Paranoia", "Eventually", and finally, "Disciples". At times,
            their lyrics are hard to understand. But, after a few listens, the tune and the unique syncopated beat, will have you singing every word for the next three days.
            Their album covers often feature bright colors, with differing patterns. The most recent album, is most pleasing to the eye (or third eye, as they would say). With 
            the purple gradient, and distrubting silver sphere in the middle, Tame Impala has created a cover that is a drastic departure from the mainstream
            music industry.
